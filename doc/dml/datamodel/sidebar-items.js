This lets the renderer know that introspection encountered unsupported names or features and these are supposed to be rendered as comments. Since the parser will not set these flags when reading a schema string, only introspection and the lowering of the datamodel to the ast care about these flags. The FieldType: Unsupported behaves in the same way. Both of these are never converted into the internal datamodel."]]});
